		<description homepage="https://github.com/irmen/Pyrolite">
		This library allows your Java program to interface very easily with the Python world. It uses the Pyro protocol to call methods on remote objects. (See https://github.com/irmen/Pyro4). To that end, it also contains and uses a feature complete pickle protocol implementation -read and write- to exchange data with Pyro/Python.

Pyrolite only implements part of the client side Pyro library, hence its name &apos;lite&apos;...  But because Pyrolite has no dependencies, it is a much lighter way to use Pyro from Java/.NET than a solution with jython+pyro or IronPython+Pyro would provide. So if you don&apos;t need Pyro&apos;s full feature set, and don&apos;t require your Java/.NET code to host Pyro objects itself, Pyrolite may be a good choice to connect java or .NET and python.
